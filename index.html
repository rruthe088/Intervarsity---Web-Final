                    <p>Here, at Rock Valley College, we have a very diverse population, both in the type of students and the type of wildlife that roam here. We get a very dense population of geese, along with some swans, robins, ducks, squirrels, and other such animals. On the student side, we get applicants from all over the world. People come from places such as California, Texas, Europe, and even Asia.</p>

                    <p>Throughout our college, study spaces for students are laid in just about every building. This way, students have many options on where they can study, may it be a desk, a geometric couch seat and table, or maybe even a sofa chair. All of these can be found throughout campus, along with the availability of renting out a Study Room in the library, for those looking for a quiet place to study.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Go confidently in the direction of your dreams and live the life you have imagined." ~Henry David Thoreau<br>"Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions." ~Dali Lamo<br></blockquote>
                    <p>One of the most recent additions to many of the newly renovated buildings on campus are the inspirational quotations displayed on the walls. These quotes and the faculty themselves, make this college a much more friendly and safe place.</p>

                    <p>Our chapter's moto is to Transform your life, Renew the campus, and Change the world. This is what Intervarsity is meant to be. Yes, it's an amazing community of people who hang out and have fun, but it's also a group learning about the Gospel and of Jesus Christ, while also growing into leaders to help renew our campus, and maybe one day change the world. The great thing about Intervarsity is that even though it's a Christian Fellowship Organization, you don't have to be a christian to join. Everyone is accepted and welcome.</p>

                    <p>Just a couple of weeks ago, our school's Intervarsity chapter took a trip down to Kingston, IL, for an event known as Fall Retreat. It's meant to be a weekend where students can take their mind off of the stress of school for two days, and jump into the scripture and glory of God. The cool thing about this trip, not only is that students get to create close bonds between each other, but also that they get to meet other students who are in the same situations, or who share the same faith, who are from other schools. This is also helpful for anyone who wants to transfer to those schools, so that they might get to know someone and have a friend when they actually do transfer.</p>

                    <p>This year is one of the rare three years that the Urbana Missions Conference takes place. This year it's happening in St. Louis, MO. This event hosted by Intervarsity brings people from all over the world to talk about missions. This is an amazing experience that you can learn more about through their youtube page by clicking on their link near the bottom of the page, or the invitation video link above, or by going to <a href="http://www.urbana.org">www.urbana.org.</a> Another good thing about this event, is that not only will there be a diverse amount of people, but there's also going to be opportunities for students to talk to colleges or companies interested in seeking internships or future job opportunities.</p>
